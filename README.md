# hello-world
My first attempt at/use of github

My name is Stefan Sande and i am a Web-Developer.
Funny how this is only just my first use of github, 
especially seeing as i have been in the web-dev game
for over 2 years now. Well, "better late than never", 
they say.

So, let the git games begin!!!
